This folder contains code for fitting a SEIR model to epidemiological data for the COVID-19 outbreak in Ireland, as reported in [1].

The folder Single-fit runs the simulated annealing to find optimal parameter values
The folder Bootstrapping finds the optimal parameters, and then creates synthetic data to compute the confidence intervals.
